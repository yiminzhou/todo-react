# A Todo App with React.js

After working with Ember.js for almost 3 years, I think it's time for me to learn something new.

I find Ember and React very similar, but also different. Ember is more structured with loads of helper functions e.g. `Ember.computed`, while React allows for more flexibility, which also means more responsibilities. The most important difference for me is one-way vs two-way binding.
